![Dev Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Joearrowsmith/remote_patient_monitoring.svg?branch=dev)

Real-time patient visualisation of vital signs with a simple easy to read UI.

### Vitals requirements:

- [ ] Body temperature
- [ ] Heart rate
- [ ] Respiratory rate
- [ ] Blood pressure
- [ ] ECG

### Feature requirements:

- [ ] A display of each vital sign plotted over the last n records, where n is selectable and display of ECG
- [ ] Visual alarms that indicate if the values are outside normal value
  - [ ] Warning
  - [ ] Urgent
- [ ] A permanent record to be kept of average values for every minute during a day and also instances when there have been abnormal signs
- [ ] A tunable simulation of the vital signs and ECG for the system to display:
  - [ ] Simulate a normal patient
  - [ ] Simulate a patient who has abnormal vital signs
  
  
### Feature desirables:

- [ ] The ability to monitor multiple patients at the same time - records to be kept of each patient's identity details
- [ ] Audio and email alarms
- [ ] Audio indication of heart beat
- [ ] A report generated of the average values recorded during a day, and when any abnormal signs happened
